# Document-Layout-Classification-SVM
Scanned Document layout clustering using Kmeans
1)	Using Googleâ€™s Inception V3 model for extracting the features of the image to be classified.
2)	Inception V3 basically is used to categorize objects present inside any image, it can also present the image features(Spatial, textural etc) in form of an array.
3)	In our case we are using the features as generated by the Inception V3 to train our SVM classifier model.
4)	We have trained our model using the same features as extracted by Inception Model.
5)	On our testing data(75 samples) our model showed accuracy of 90%.
